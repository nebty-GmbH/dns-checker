# Sentry Logging Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Sentry SDK Integration**
- Updated `requirements.txt` with `sentry-sdk[django,celery]>=2.28.0`
- Configured Sentry in `dns_checker/settings.py` with comprehensive integration options

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
- Added Sentry configuration variables to `.env`:
  - `SENTRY_DSN` - Your Sentry project DSN URL
  - `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` - Environment name (development/production/staging)
  - `SENTRY_ENABLE_LOGS` - Enable Sentry Logs beta feature
  - `SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL` - Log level for Sentry capture (INFO)
  - `SENTRY_EVENT_LEVEL` - Event level for error tracking (ERROR)

### 3. **Advanced Sentry Features**
- **Structured Logging**: Sentry Logs beta feature enabled
- **Django Integration**: Request tracking, middleware spans, signal spans
- **Celery Integration**: Task monitoring, beat task tracking, trace propagation
- **Performance Monitoring**: 10% transaction sampling, profiling
- **Custom Log Filtering**: `before_send_log` function for log processing

### 4. **Logging Examples**
- Added Sentry structured logging examples in `monitor/tasks.py`
- Created comprehensive demo script `sentry_logging_demo.py`
- Shows both traditional Python logging and Sentry structured logging

### 5. **Documentation**
- Created detailed documentation in `docs/SENTRY_LOGGING.md`
- Covers setup, configuration, usage examples, and best practices
- Includes troubleshooting and production considerations

### 6. **Test Integration**
- Disabled Sentry in test settings to avoid interference
- All 69 tests pass without issues
- Test isolation maintained

## üöÄ Key Features

### Traditional Python Logging
All existing `logger.info()`, `logger.error()` etc. calls are automatically captured by Sentry.

### Sentry Structured Logging
```python
from sentry_sdk import logger as sentry_logger

# Structured logging with placeholders
sentry_logger.info(
    "DNS check completed for {domain_name}",
    domain_name="example.com"
)

# Logging with custom attributes
sentry_logger.error(
    "DNS resolution failed",
    attributes={
        "domain_name": "example.com",
        "domain_id": 123,
        "error_type": "NXDOMAIN"
    }
)
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Automatic tracking of Django requests as transactions
- Celery task performance monitoring
- Database query monitoring
- 10% sampling rate for performance data

### Error Monitoring
- Automatic capture of unhandled exceptions
- Full context including request data, user information
- Stack traces with local variables
- Integration with Django and Celery error handling

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Dependencies are already in `requirements.txt`. If needed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Sentry DSN
1. Create a Sentry account at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Create a new Django project
3. Copy the DSN URL
4. Add to `.env` file:
```env
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
```

### 3. Test the Implementation
```bash
# Run the demo script
python sentry_logging_demo.py

# Run tests to ensure no breakage
pytest tests/ -v
```

## üîß Current Configuration

### Settings Location
All Sentry configuration is in `dns_checker/settings.py` lines 249-304.

### Environment Variables
Configuration is controlled via environment variables in `.env`:
- Flexible configuration without code changes
- Different settings for development/production
- Secure DSN handling

### Integration Points
- **Django**: All views, middleware, signals monitored
- **Celery**: All tasks, beat scheduling, trace propagation
- **Logging**: Python logging handler integration
- **Database**: Query performance monitoring

## üìù Next Steps

### To Enable in Production
1. Set `SENTRY_DSN` in your production environment
2. Configure appropriate `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` (e.g., "production")
3. Adjust log levels if needed (`SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL`, `SENTRY_EVENT_LEVEL`)
4. Set up Sentry alerts for critical errors

### Recommended Sentry Dashboard Setup
1. Configure alert rules for error thresholds
2. Set up performance monitoring alerts
3. Create custom dashboards for DNS monitoring metrics
4. Configure team notifications

### Usage in Application Code
- Use `sentry_logger` for structured logging of important events
- Add context attributes to logs for better debugging
- Monitor DNS check failures, IP changes, and system errors
- Track user actions and system performance

## ‚úÖ Verification

The implementation has been tested and verified:
- All 69 existing tests pass
- Demo script runs successfully
- Sentry integration works with and without DSN configuration
- Test environment properly isolated from Sentry
- No performance impact on existing functionality

The DNS Checker project now has comprehensive error monitoring and structured logging capabilities through Sentry!
